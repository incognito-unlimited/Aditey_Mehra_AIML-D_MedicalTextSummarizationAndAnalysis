# HealthInsight

HealthInsight is a Streamlit-based web application designed to help users understand their medical reports. Users can upload medical reports in PDF, DOCX, TXT, or XML formats, view extracted text, receive an automated analysis, and ask specific questions about their reports. The application leverages the Groq API for natural language processing and medical report analysis.

## Features
- **File Upload**: Supports multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, XML).
- **Automated Analysis**: Generates a detailed analysis of the medical report, including potential illnesses, critical values, medications, lifestyle changes, and follow-up tests.
- **Question Interface**: Allows users to ask specific questions about their reports with responses powered by the Groq API.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit for a clean and intuitive experience.
- **Privacy Focus**: Redacts sensitive identifiers during text preprocessing.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- A Groq API key (set up via environment variables)
- Required Python packages (listed in `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jayantparashar10/healthinsight.git
   cd healthinsight
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root.
   - Add your Groq API key:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your-groq-api-key
     ```
   - Use `python-dotenv` to load these variables (already included in the code).

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The application will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage
1. **Upload a Medical Report**:
   - Navigate to the application in your browser.
   - Use the file uploader to select a medical report (PDF, DOCX, TXT, or XML).
   - The extracted text will be displayed in an expandable section.

2. **View Automated Analysis**:
   - Once the file is processed, an automated analysis will appear, highlighting key medical insights.

3. **Ask Questions**:
   - Enter specific questions about the report in the text input field.
   - Responses will be displayed in a conversation history section.

4. **Note**:
   - Always consult a healthcare professional for personalized medical advice. HealthInsight is an informational tool, not a substitute for professional medical guidance.

## Dependencies
Listed in `requirements.txt`:
```
streamlit
groq
PyPDF2
python-docx
python-dotenv
```
Additional dependencies may be required based on your environment (e.g., `lxml` for XML processing).

## System Prompt
The application uses a carefully crafted system prompt to ensure effective and safe responses:
- Emphasizes that the AI is not a doctor and professional consultation is necessary.
- Provides clear, non-technical explanations.
- Highlights urgent concerns and suggests follow-up actions.
- Maintains privacy by avoiding discussion of personal identifiers.

## Limitations
- The application relies on the quality and clarity of the uploaded report. Incomplete or poorly formatted reports may result in limited analysis.
- The Groq API has usage limits; ensure your API key has sufficient quota.
- Currently supports only PDF, DOCX, TXT, and XML formats.
